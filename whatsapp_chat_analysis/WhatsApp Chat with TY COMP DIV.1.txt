Science Club invites you for a journey which will be going through amazing experiments, interesting visits, brain storming sessions, challenging projects, lectures by scientists and many more...All you need is just to crack a threshold of a small interview. So, come and join the inductions on Thursday in AC. Ready to take off??? See you there!!☺️

The *COEP Satellite Team*🛰, which built the picosatellite "Swayam", launched in 2016, is *holding inductions*. The team is currently working on a solar sailing nanosatellite that changes its orbit using solar radiation pressure, no fuel or thrusters! 

Inductions are being held for Coding, Electronics and Structures. 

Working in the team will give you great opportunities to learn and explore. 
More specifically: coders will gain experience of working on a large, real codebase. Electronics members will be able to work on circuit design and analysis , signal processing, and PCB  design. Structures members will design, simulate and create mechanisms and perform thermal and vibrational simulations.

The question papers will go online at

Ever thought of *RENTING EDUCATIONAL BOOKS* online? Yes, renting educational books, be it *SEMESTER, ENTRANCE EXAM or REFERENCE BOOKS*📚. As students, BOOKS are the second biggest expense after fees. Most books are needed for a small period of time, some for a few days and others for a few months or semesters. If these costs are minimized, a significant amount of money can be saved. If this sounds right to you, we think you'll like it here.  

WE ARE HAPPY TO INTRODUCE YOU TO💥 *MARTOLEX!* 💥                            

Martolex is an online marketplace where you can buy books for a certain period of time and return them to us and *get up to 70% of the book amount back!*   Through this venture, we are helping students save money 💵 and time ⏳.

16/03/20, 4:17 pm - Chetas Borse: Dear Students,


In continuation of my earlier (trailing) email dated 14th March 2020, it is hereby notified to you all that the campus shall remain CLOSED for academic instruction till 31st March 2020. 


A circular, with an exclusive mention of this date (31st march) has been issued by the authorities and attached to this email for your reference. 


The tentative dates for T2 (which was otherwise scheduled during 20th-22nd March) are now proposed to be  10th, 11th and 12th April 2020. The academic term is also subject to extension to compensate for instruction days which we have lost due to this unforeseen break, about which you will be notified later. 


All are again advised to stay in touch with the Institute's website and check respective emails from COEP regularly, for further notices regarding extension of the academic break OR resuming the academic routine after 31st March 2020.


Take care wherever you are!!

13/04/20, 6:06 pm - Chetas Borse: ```Dear Students,
 
We hope you are staying safe and taking care of yourself and others during these unprecedented times.

The Hon’ble Chief Minister of Maharashtra has announced a further lockdown period up to 30th April 2020 in the State.

The Heads and Deans of the institute had an online meeting today to address our academic concerns.

As a precautionary measure, It has been decided that the institute will remain CLOSED until 10th May 2020. However, this is subject to further review. If the lock down period is again extended, we will NOTIFY the next closure date to you.

As of now, your tentative date for reporting back to campus is Monday, 11th May 2020.
This date being tentative, we will RE-CONFIRM the date of  11th May once again as the situation improves.


Your respective course Faculty will continue to engage you in an online mode. I reiterate, each course Faculty will decide on the (i) mode of online academic engagement; (ii) portion for T2 evaluation; (iii) Whether T2 will be online or ‘in-class’ when you return to campus. 


With the Faculty initiative, with  their responsiveness  and courage to continue the good work undeterred by circumstances, please co-operate with them in attending to their online engagement. 

I urge students to play an instrumental role in helping COEP Faculty rise to the challenge of COVID-19 and in allowing them to complete this semesters curriculum by 10th May 2020 in online mode.

The Lab sessions/practical’s and of course, the Project work for Final year students, all will resume and accelerate, once you are back to the campus. 

Also once campus resumes, the face to face learning will continue to facilitate you and help you brush-up/revise whatever you have learnt in the online mode. This face to face learning will also help the Faculty resolve, address your difficulties and take up more examples/case studies to strengthen whatever you have learnt from your Faculty in online mode.


How do we end the semester? We are not addressing this issue at this point in time, as we do not know how the situation will unfold. But we will try to see how to mitigate the situation as we go along in time. 


This year we do not see conduct of a Summer term, for First year and Final Year students. However, we will facilitate, rather substitute, the Summer term with a supplementary exam of the Odd Semesters for those students of First Year and Final Year who could not clear  some of their courses in the Odd Semester. 
This supplementary examination would naturally be scheduled after ESE. 
The Re-exam for failed courses of Even semester would also take place. As of now, it is quite untimely to suggest the exact dates of ESE and thus it's Re-exam and Supplementary Exam of Odd Semester Courses. You will be updated at proper juncture of time, once we all join the campus. 

Needless to mention, this unexpected situation, has forced us to stay at home and work therefrom. So this long ABSENCE from campus will be treated as VACATION, so We will not have a SUMMER VACATION, this year. 

From 15th April until 31st May, you should consider concurrently engaging yourself with online internships. If you have difficulty in getting an online internship, you may contact your respective Faculty Advisor or your Head of the Department. They will help facilitate this.

Please keep yourself engaged in academic activities.

Thus, till the time we are back at campus again, am requesting our faculty members to continue their effort in engaging with the students in online mode. 

Several Faculty have helped in evolving various solutions, and our thanks to each one of them!

Please continue to take care of your health and well-being, while supporting and uplifting one another in the family.

04/05/20, 6:21 pm - Urvi Coep: Dear Students,

 

The current situation has affected our lives in unfamiliar ways and trust that you and your family members are coping well in these challenging times that demand extraordinary resilience.

 

The Government has announced a further lock down period up to 17th May 2020 in the country, though with certain relaxations in some areas/cities. Even as the menace of COVID-19 continues unabated in the city of Pune, we have been doing reasonably well with our online academic engagement. I thank you for your support in responding to our Faculty and in receiving online education.

 

The Heads and Deans of the institute have been continuously in touch over e-meetings to address our academic concerns.


As a further preventive measure, we have decided that the institute will remain CLOSED until 14th June 2020, for ALL Students. However, this is subject to further review. If the lock down period is again extended, we will NOTIFY the next date to you.


As of now, we have decided to plan your reporting back to the campus in a DIFFERENTIAL and STAGGERED manner.


In discussions with the Heads and Deans today, we have the following tentatively charted updates for you:

 

1.    The Faculty will complete the content delivery/teaching of your respective theory courses, for all UG and PG programs, in e-learning mode, by 10th May 2020.

 

2.    All Final Year B.Tech (including hostelite's) and S.Y M.Tech students shall report back to campus for resumption of academics on Monday 15th June 2020. The free period, thus made available, from 10th May to 14th June may be utilized for completion of simulations/programming/software part of your labs and/or project/dissertation, or as a preparation leave for assimilation of knowledge from theory courses towards End Semester Examination.  

 

Subsequent FIVE weeks (from 15th June onward), on campus, until 19th July, the pending laboratory work, project/dissertation work (hardware realization/setup building prototype/model making), Test-2 (for 20 marks, in case not taken) etc. will be completed by your respective lab teachers/guides. Your End Semester Examination  will be scheduled, on-campus, tentatively between 20th July to 31st July, including your lab/viva/oral exams. Your project/dissertation presentations/orals will be arranged in August first week. We will try our best to announce your results by THIRD week of August and hold the Graduation Ceremony by August end.

 

It may please be noted that for failure students, the Re-exam will be conducted during 17th to 29th August, and thus these students may not be eligible to participate in Graduation ceremony.

 

3.    All FY, SY, TY UG Students and FY M.Tech students shall report back to the campus on 20th July 2020, and until 14th August will be facilitated by the respective teachers for pending lab work, face-to-face teaching for remaining topics, if any, Test-2 (of 20 marks, if not taken in the lock down period), mini projects etc.

 

So, in the so longer free period, thus made available between 10th May to 19th July, the TY students, who received internship, may continue with their internship assignments. Remaining TY students, all FY & SY- UG students and FY-PG students will optionally enroll for VIRTUAL INTERNSHIP on priority, OR undertake a MOOC, related to the curriculum of the forthcoming term or IFC/Honors/Minor streams. Such MOOC will be suggested and mentored by your FACULTY  ADVISOR, from available online resource such as NPTEL/Coursera/Edx/Khan Academy etc.

 

Your End Semester Examination will be tentatively scheduled in the period of 17th August to 29th August. You will have the lab and mini-project exams of Even term (of 2019-20), scheduled on Saturdays/Sundays of September 2020, i.e. during earlier part of the forthcoming Odd term. We will try our best to announce the results of this Even term, by end of September 2020.

 

Your registration for the Odd term of 2020-21 will begin on 31st August and 1st September, followed by immediate start of classes of the term. All students will be permitted to migrate to the next semester, however, as and when results are announced by end September 2020, based on these results, the successful students shall continue with the Odd term of AY 2020-21, but failures may need to drop the term and appear for Re-exams.

 

4.    Since  the available academic working days for the Odd term will be less, we may need to declare all Saturdays also as instruction days to compensate for the academic loss and complete academics in all respects.

 

5. The mode of End Semester Examination, for ALL students, will be confirmed and communicated later, but it will be ensured that, during examinations, all the hygiene, safety and sanitation conditions will be complied with, as per the Government guidelines, for COVID-19. 

 

All of the above is TENTATIVE and will be enforced and implemented if lock down is LIFTED ON 17th May 2020. If lock down period is extended beyond 17th May 2020, a new schedule will be sent to you.


A committee of all Hostel Rectors has been set up to examine all aspects of ‘REBOOTING’ the academic and hostel campus, following all relevant guidelines, issued by the Government from time to time, in letter and spirit, to eradicate, combat and arrest the spread of COVID-19, and thus ensure a safe campus for all of us.  Micro planning is being undertaken with regards to the timing, the sequence in which the students should be brought in, precautions to be taken in respect of re-entering staff and students, precautions to be taken when we resume teaching-research-admin activities etc. 


This committee is convened by Chief Rector  Prof. Ranjekar.  In case you have suggestions on these matters, please send them to Prof. Ranjekar (gm@coep.ac.in). 

 

I would like to thank and appreciate all our Faculty, who despite all the myriad issues during these unprecedented times have stood by the academic concerns and delivered to the best of their abilities. Also, there are many Faculty and Staff even more outside of any of the committees, who are silently working in the background to let us enjoy a semblance of normal education. My heartfelt gratitude to them as well.


Dean-Student Affairs is going to circulate an 'Online Survey Questionnaire' to all of you (on Google form), regarding the issues and difficulties you faced in availing/participating in our e-learning initiatives during lock down period. You all should responsibly respond to this survey to get us a feel on problems related to uninterrupted connectivity,  device (laptop/smart phone), electricity etc. at your end.

 

I wish and hope you and your family members are safe at home. Do take good care of yourself.

 *Regarding PL Assignments and MiniProject Evaluation*

 ```1) Sir will start the evaluation from 18th May. You can schedule a team meet from 18th at 2 pm on Microsoft teams and invite your group members and sir on it and you can demonstrate your project and assignments on it. If you are not comfortable with the above mentioned time you can contact sir and schedule meet at some other time.

2) Create a Git repository for assignments and miniproject. 

3) Miniproject:
Sir has already shared a notebook for miniproject. Enter the details of your miniproject, members in your project and share your miniproject repository link.

From 18th may, please enter the names of the groups willing to demonstrate project/assignments on this group so that all those students can join the same meeting.```

Just thinking that we all could actually request faculty
03/06/20, 12:05 pm - Deepika Coep: how you were able to give twice
03/06/20, 12:06 pm - +91 95037 69438: One from teams, one via link
03/06/20, 12:06 pm - Deepika Coep: Due to heavy rains, many people are facing net connectivity issues, or they have a really low bandwidth, so its getting difficult for students to access moodle to teams , as questions are getting loaded too slow or it shows some error page, which really demotivates us.Also many other technical issues are there.
It happened us for two subjects.
So we kindly request you to either switch it to google forms or send us some assignments, which we can submit.
03/06/20, 12:06 pm - Deepika Coep: can we just send something like this to professors..
03/06/20, 12:06 pm - +91 95037 69438: 👍

*Society of Women Engineers (SWE)* is an international, non-profit ,educational service organization dedicated to raising awareness for the need of women engineers and encouraging young women to consider engineering as an education. 

Looking forward to promoting women in Sci-Tech and creating a community for engineers (who happen to be women) within COEP, a heritage of engineering studies in India.

21/07/20, 6:35 pm - Chetas Borse: MIS: 111803056 to 111803077 join the below group

https://chat.whatsapp.com/JmWRb4H0Meh1Di9yXiZBJy
21/07/20, 6:35 pm - Chetas Borse: Strictly above mentioned mis nos. and no one else
22/07/20, 8:52 pm - Chetas Borse: Hope all of you have received the division-wise time table announced by your department. Every theory course is planned for FOUR sessions in a week, each of 45 minutes duration and laboratory course with every session planned for 90 minutes duration. Sufficient in between breaks are planned in the time table so that high attention and retention levels are maintained during your learning from online sessions. For every 3 credits course, there will be live streaming of 3 lecture sessions and an additional interaction session to clear the doubts of the previous 3 lectures. The faculty will share the video recording of the lectures and an assignment for the week by Friday evening and you are required to submit the assignment solution by Sunday same week by 11.59 pm. These assignments will be generally short in nature and the Course Faculty will inform you about the same. The semester assessment pattern is also slightly modified to accommodate the online teaching-learning. 10% weight age Marks are allocated for participation in the sessions in terms of attendance and interaction. Proctored End Semester Examination shall be organized by Exam cell for awarding 50% weightage marks. The remaining 40% wightage marks will be decided by the respective course faculty and will be declared to you in the first lecture session itself. A draft guideline for distribution of this 40 marks may be 20% marks for assignment evaluations and 20% marks for the mid semester online examination.
        
Your Head of the Department must have also intimated to you- who your Faculty Mentor is and you would have already started the association with your Faculty-Mentor. 
 
You can now login in MIS portal to view all the eligible courses you may register in the odd term by following the link “Login >> Registrations >> Semester Credit Registration-Eligible Courses”. The responsibility of planning and deciding which all courses to be registered in this semester is lying with you. As a special consideration in this semester, there will not be any restriction on number of credits eligible for registration. Keeping the time table aside and along with the guidance from your Faculty Mentor, you can carefully decide which all courses are to be registered for the coming semester without time table overlapping, while ensuring learning burden, which is within your capacity and as much as you can take.   The more the number of courses you register, the more you have to exert, hence there is a chance that your CGPA may drop. Please seek advice from your FACULTY MENTOR while registering for all the courses.
 
It is mandatory to submit  
1.	“Yearly Exit Feedback” in MIS by following the link “Login >> Exit Survey >>YearlyExitFeedback”. The link is already opened in MIS.
2.	“Yearly Fees Payment Detail” in MIS by following the link “Login >> Academic >> YearlyFeesPayment”. The link is already opened in MIS.  
After these two mandatory submissions in MIS, you will be eligible for the odd Semester Credits registration of AY 2020-21. 
It is mandatory to participate in the first phase of semester registration in MIS on 30th July 2020 itself for the theory and laboratory courses (without having options). Failure in non-completing the mandatory first phase registration on 30th July will lead to late registration with additional late fees payment. The last day of semester credit registration with late fees is 7th August 2020. In case of late registration, a student is required to pay Rs 100/- per every day of late starting with an initial late fees of Rs 500/- (31st July, Rs. 500/-, 1st August, Rs. 600/-, 3rd August Rs. 800/-, ... 7th August Rs. 1200/-). “Late Fees Payment Detail” in MIS may be submitted by following the link “Login >> Academic >> Late Fees Payment”. We are more interested in the discipline with you which you follow the timelines than your late fees.
The registration of ILOE/LLC/DE courses (with options) will be taken on 31st July 2020 those who have completed the first phase of registration on 30th July 2020.
The list of Open Electives (ILOEs) for final UG has been uploaded on COEP Portal under "Notices" Tab, for your perusal. The students of the respective classes are hereby instructed to browse through the concerned list cautiously and exert your preferences in the order of priority. It is mandatory to assign numerical choice to each and every course in the list. Also exert your preferences for “Liberal Learning Courses” in the order of priority.
 
You may consult your Faculty Mentor in case of any difficulty. Later, the Faculty Mentor shall APPROVE the list of courses being registered by their students, after due verification.  
 
For all aspiring and eligible SY (transited from FY) students who wish to change their B.Tech Program (Branch Change), a separate email will be shared. 
  
For all TY students, we have TWO academic initiatives:

(i)  A 2-credit elective course in Humanities and Social Sciences, for which each and every student has to exert the choice and

(ii) Honors/Minor certifications schemes: Students having CGPA score more than 6.5 upto 4th semester and NO BACKLOG, can participate in the scheme, by exercising the option for either "Honors" or "Minor" by following the MIS link, “Login >> Academic >>Honors/Minor Scheme Options Registration”. A separate mail will come from me regarding the concept of Honors/Minor schemes.

Based on your experience and exposure with the MIS, we presume that you all will complete the semester credits registration process in a successful way. It is an appeal from desk of Dean Academics, Examination Cell and MIS team to follow the registration process on time on the scheduled dates meticulously under the supervision of concerned Faculty Mentor/HoD.

Odd Semester of Academic Year 2020-21 Instructions will begin in online mode on 3rd August 2020, as per the scheduled time table.
